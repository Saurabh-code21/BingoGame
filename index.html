                        <li>To start the game, the game-master(or may be you) will distribute a Bingo card to each player.</li>
                        <li>Each player then gets ready with the Bingo card and "RESET" the card. To shuffle the numbers randomly in the card.</li>
                        <li>The First caller calls out a number(any number available in the card : 1-25).</li>
                        <li>Players look for that number in their cards and mark it done by clicking it.</li>
                        <li>The number is also placed in their respective tally card (for everyone to verify in the end).</li>
                        <li>Then calling of numbers continues in a particular sequence of players.</li>
                        <li>During calling out numbers you can only call the numbers which are free and not marked already</li>
                        <li>When a player has marked - a complete a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, 
                            then player can mark one of the characters in the header row "B I N G O".

                        <li>When a player has marked all characters in header row "B I N G O", the player calls out "BINGO!"
                        </li>
                        <li>When a player calls out "BINGO!", 
                            the player has to share both the Bingo and Tally card with everyone 
                            everyone can check the player's card against their Tally card and make certain 
                            that the numbers marked, have been called (and marked in their's too).
                        </li>
                        <li>If there is a game master, he/she can maintain a Master Tally card as well. 
                            So whenever anyone calls "BINGO!", game master can also confirm the WIN or if it is a WRONG CALL, 
                            by checking the player's card against their Master Tally card.
